# Using AI to Plan My Career Pivot

## The Problem

I'm an interior designer trying to break into AI creative technology.

On paper, this makes no sense.

**Interior design:**
- Physical spaces
- Client relationships
- Aesthetic judgment
- Material constraints

**AI Creative Tech:**
- Digital products
- Code and automation
- Technical implementation
- AI orchestration

These fields seem completely unrelated.

**Except they're not.**

---

## The Realization

After building [Artifactum](/projects/artifactum/)—a complete murder mystery game in 2 weeks using Claude, Sora, Gemini, and Python automation—I realized something:

**I'm not just someone who dabbles with AI tools.**

I orchestrate them. I direct them. I use them to build complete creative experiences.

That's not "knowing how to use ChatGPT." That's a different skill entirely.

But what's the job title for that? Where are these companies? What do they actually pay? How do I position my weird background as an asset instead of a liability?

**I had no idea.**

---

## The Solution: AI-Powered Strategic Research

Here's what I did:

**I asked Claude to research my entire career transition.**

Not "give me some job suggestions." Not "write me a resume."

I asked for:
- Complete European market analysis for AI creative tech roles
- Specific role profiles matching my background
- Target companies prioritized by remote-friendliness and cultural fit
- Portfolio optimization strategies
- Application tactics for career changers
- A concrete 90-day action plan

**The result:** A 15,000-word strategic research report that I would have paid thousands for from a career consultant.

## What I Learned

### 1. The Market Is Exploding

**AI Creative Technologist roles are growing 100-200%+ across Europe.**

Germany: **+109% in AI job postings**  
UK: **+120%**  
Ireland: **+204%**

And **89% offer remote or hybrid options.**

This means I can access UK/German/Dutch salaries (€55k-€85k) while staying in Lisbon.

**I had no idea this opportunity existed.**

### 2. "Prompt Engineering" Is Dead

Remember when everyone said "Prompt Engineer" was the hot new job?

**It's not. That role collapsed in 2024.**

Job postings dropped **80-90% from the 2022 peak.** The few remaining positions pay far less than the "$375k" headlines suggested.

**Why?** AI models got too good. GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini can now optimize their own prompts faster than humans can iterate.

**What replaced it:** Broader roles that require actual creative + technical hybrid skills:
- AI Creative Technologist (my target)
- AI Product Designer
- AI Experience Designer
- Conversation Designer
- Interactive Developer

These roles need people who can build complete experiences, not just write better prompts.

**That's exactly what Artifactum proved I can do.**

### 3. My Interior Design Background Is Actually an Advantage

This was the revelation.

**What interior design taught me:**
- How environments affect human emotion and behavior
- Balancing aesthetics with functionality
- Managing complex constraints (budget, space, materials)
- Translating abstract client needs into concrete solutions
- Visual communication and aesthetic judgment

**How this applies to AI creative tech:**
- Understanding user experience in designed environments (physical → digital)
- Spatial thinking applied to interface and interaction design
- Creative problem-solving under constraints (time, technology, scope)
- Client collaboration skills (user research, product thinking)
- Design literacy that pure engineers lack

**The narrative shift:** This isn't a random career pivot. It's a strategic evolution applying the same core skills to a different medium.

## The Companies

Claude identified **15 target companies** prioritized by remote-friendliness and cultural fit.

**Top tier:**
- **ElevenLabs** (voice AI, fully remote, $6.6B valuation)
- **Stability AI** (creators of Stable Diffusion, 100% remote in Europe)
- **Media.Monks** (8,600+ digital professionals, major clients)
- **HuggingFace** (remote-first, AI model hub)

**What they're looking for:**
- Portfolio demonstrating shipped products
- Hands-on AI fluency (Midjourney, Runway, Claude, Stable Diffusion)
- Technical + creative hybrid ability
- Python proficiency for automation
- Storytelling skills
- Remote work capabilities

**What I have:** Artifactum proves all of this.

## The 90-Day Action Plan

Claude didn't just give me research. It gave me a **concrete execution plan.**

### Weeks 1-2: Portfolio Enhancement
- Transform Artifactum into comprehensive case study
- Create process video showing workflow
- Optimize GitHub profile
- Set up social presence (Twitter, LinkedIn)

### Weeks 3-6: Portfolio Expansion
- Build AI interior visualization tool (leverages my unique background)
- Create detailed "making of" documentation
- Write 3 blog posts establishing thought leadership
- Build in public on Twitter

### Weeks 7-10: Application Sprint
- Research top 20 companies deeply
- Execute "backdoor strategy" (connect with employees before applying)
- Customize portfolio for 3 role types
- Apply to 15 targeted positions

### Months 3-6: Scaling
- Open source contributions
- Conference attendance (TechEx Europe, AI Rush)
- Third portfolio piece based on interview feedback
- Active interview processes

**Target:** First offers around month 5-6.

## What Makes This Different

### This Isn't Generic Career Advice

Claude didn't give me "10 tips for job searching" or "how to write a resume."

It gave me:
- Specific salary ranges by country
- Actual company names with hiring insights
- Cultural fit analysis
- Application strategies for my exact background
- Portfolio tactics for AI creatives
- Weekly milestones with success metrics

**This is strategic intelligence I couldn't have gathered alone.**

### The AI Collaboration Model

I didn't just ask "What jobs should I apply for?"

I gave Claude:
- My complete background (interior design → Artifactum)
- My constraints (Lisbon-based, prefer remote)
- My skills (AI orchestration, Python, creative direction)
- My goals (€55k-€85k, creative + technical hybrid role)

**Then I asked it to think strategically.**

The result: A research report that understands my specific situation and provides actionable intelligence.

## The Honest Part

### What AI Can't Do

Claude can't:
- Make the career change for me
- Guarantee I'll get hired
- Replace networking and relationship-building
- Predict which companies will actually respond
- Know if I'll succeed

**I still have to:**
- Build the portfolio pieces
- Make the connections
- Write the applications
- Do the interviews
- Execute the plan

**But what it enabled:** Starting with strategic intelligence instead of blind guessing.

---

## Why I'm Sharing This Publicly

**Reason 1: Building in Public**

Documenting this journey creates visibility. Recruiters might find this post. People in my network might make connections. Sharing the process is part of the strategy.

**Reason 2: Demonstrating AI Collaboration Skills**

Using AI for strategic research is exactly the kind of thinking Creative Technologist roles require. This post is part of my portfolio.

**Reason 3: It Might Help Someone Else**

If you're making an unconventional career transition, this shows:
- How to use AI for strategic planning
- How to position non-traditional backgrounds
- How to research emerging job markets
- How to create concrete action plans

**Reason 4: Accountability**

Publishing this plan makes me more likely to execute it. Now it's out there.

---

## What Happens Next

I'm executing this plan starting now.

**You can follow along:**
- Weekly progress updates on Twitter/LinkedIn
- Portfolio pieces published as they're built
- Application insights and interview experiences
- Behind-the-scenes of the job search process

This is an experiment in:
- Using AI for life-changing strategic decisions
- Turning unconventional backgrounds into competitive advantages
- Building in public during career transition
- Documenting what actually works (and what doesn't)

---

## The Meta Layer

**Here's the irony:** Using Claude to plan my career transition into AI creative tech is itself a demonstration of the exact skills these roles require.

I didn't just use AI. I:
- Identified what strategic intelligence I needed
- Structured the research questions effectively
- Directed Claude to produce actionable insights
- Synthesized the results into a concrete plan
- Documented the process transparently

**That's AI Creative Technology work.**

Companies want people who can use AI to solve complex problems and communicate the results clearly.

**This post is the proof.**

## For Other Career Changers

If you're trying to break into a new field:

**Try this approach:**
1. Give an AI (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) your complete situation
2. Ask for strategic market research, not generic advice
3. Request specific companies, salary data, and tactics
4. Demand a concrete action plan with milestones
5. Iterate until you have actionable intelligence

**This works because:**
- AI can process more market data than you can manually research
- It can identify patterns you might miss
- It provides structured frameworks for complex decisions
- It gives you a starting point instead of blank-page paralysis

**But remember:** AI provides intelligence. You provide execution.

## The Timeline

**Research:** Complete ✅  
**Portfolio enhancement:** In progress  
**Application sprint:** Starting Week 7  
**First interviews:** Target Month 3-4  
**First offers:** Target Month 5-6

Ask me in 6 months if this worked.
