## I Make Stuff With AI

Hi, I'm Maria, and this is **Dominated by Cline**—my lab for AI-assisted creative chaos.

What started as "let's use AI to help plan a murder mystery dinner" somehow turned into a full-scale 11-character roleplay game with custom typesetting, AI-generated promotional videos, and a git-based content management system. You know, normal stuff.

So I figured I should probably document this.

## What This Site Is

This is where I experiment with AI tools and document the results—the processes that work, the spectacular failures, and everything in between.

I build creative projects using AI as a collaborator, not a replacement. The weird ideas are mine. The execution is assisted. The learning is documented. The bloopers are included.

Think of it like this: I'm the director, AI is the extremely capable (and occasionally overzealous) production team. The final product is always a collaboration.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Project showcases** with full breakdowns
- **Tool experiments** and comparisons (Claude, GPT-4, HuggingFace, Python, Typst, etc.)
- **Process documentation** from concept to completion
- **Tutorials** with reusable code and templates
- **Bloopers** because that's where the learning happens

## Current Project: Artefactum Mystery Crimes

Right now I'm wrapping up the first **Artefactum Mystery Crime**: "Christmas Murder Dinner 1926."

**Artefactum** is my series of murder mystery roleplay games—each one a self-contained experiment in AI-assisted game design. The first one features:

- 11 fully developed interconnected characters
- 100+ pages of game materials
- Custom typesetting with Typst
- AI-generated promotional assets
- A development time of about 2 weeks
- More AI tools than I can count

It went from "wouldn't it be fun to make a murder mystery" to a complete production pipeline with version control, automated builds, and modular content architecture.

Because apparently I don't know how to do things halfway.

## What's Coming Next

Over the next few posts, I'll break down exactly how this project came together:

- **How I built a murder mystery game in 2 weeks** (overview and stats)
- **AI-assisted character development** (workflow and tools)
- **Automated typesetting with Typst** (why I ditched LaTeX)
- **Modular content architecture** (git-based version control for creative projects)
- **AI asset generation pipeline** (HuggingFace experiments)
- **Bloopers and failures** (what went wrong and what I learned)

Each post will include code, templates, and tool comparisons you can actually use.

## Why "Dominated by Cline"?

Because when you work with AI tools like Claude (nicknamed "Cline"), sometimes it feels less like you're using a tool and more like the tool is running the show.

This site documents what happens when you lean into that chaos and see where it takes you.

## Let's Build Something

I don't know what's coming after Artefactum. Maybe more mystery crimes. Maybe something completely different. But it'll be documented, experimental, and probably slightly weird.

Welcome to the lab. Let's see what happens.
