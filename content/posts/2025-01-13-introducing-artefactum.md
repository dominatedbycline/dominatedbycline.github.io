## What is Artefactum?

*Artefactum* (Latin: craft, skill, artifact) is my exploration into the intersection of AI and creative work. This blog documents experiments with AI tools, programming techniques, workflows, and the artifacts that emerge from this process.

## The Purpose

As AI tools evolve rapidly, I want to:

- **Experiment** with new AI techniques and tools
- **Document** workflows and processes that work (and those that don't)
- **Share** bloopers, learnings, and final products
- **Track** the evolution of projects from concept to completion

This isn't just about polished final resultsâ€”it's about the **journey**, the **experiments**, and the **lessons learned** along the way.

## First Project: Mystery Crime Party

The inaugural project featured on Artefactum is **Christmas Murder Dinner 1926**â€”a complete murder mystery roleplay game for 11 players set in 1920s Manhattan.

This project showcases:

- **AI-assisted character development** (analyzing 11 interconnected characters)
- **Automated typesetting** with Typst (replacing LaTeX)
- **Modular content architecture** (snippet-based character sheets)
- **AI-generated video assets** via HuggingFace
- **Workflow automation** (git hooks, build scripts)

Over the coming posts, I'll break down each of these techniques, share code, discuss what worked and what failed, and provide reusable templates for similar projects.

## What to Expect

Future posts will cover:

- **AI Tools in Practice**: HuggingFace, Claude, GPT-4, and others
- **Programming Workflows**: Python automation, Typst vs LaTeX, Hugo blogs
- **Design Systems**: Modular content architecture, version control for creative projects
- **Process Documentation**: From rough idea to polished product
- **Bloopers & Failures**: Because learning happens in the mistakes

## Why "Artefactum"?

The Latin word *artefactum* means "something made with skill"â€”an artifact. It captures the essence of this blog: **creating things** using **AI as a tool**, not a replacement for craft.

Each post is itself an artifactâ€”a snapshot of a technique, a process, a learning moment.

## Coming Next

- **Post 2**: Mystery Crime Party project overview
- **Post 3**: Typst for rapid character sheet generation
- **Post 4**: Modular snippet architecture for version control
- **Post 5**: AI asset generation workflow for promotional videos

Stay tuned! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ¤–
