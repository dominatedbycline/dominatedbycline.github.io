# Why lm-arena > Standalone Sora (And I Have No Idea Why)

## The Problem

I needed a video teaser for the murder mystery game.

Requirements:
- 1920s aesthetic
- Character reveals
- Atmospheric mood
- Professional quality
- **Deadline: 1 week**

I had budget on Fal.ai for experimentation. I had access to multiple video generation tools.

**What could go wrong?**

---

## The Fal.ai Experiments

### Tool After Tool After Tool

I tested MANY programs on Fal.ai:
- Sora
- Various other video generators
- Different models
- Different parameter settings
- Different prompts

**Results?**

**Shit. All of it. Complete shit.**

Every output:
- Wrong aesthetic
- Inconsistent style
- Random artifacts
- Unusable quality
- Nothing close to what I needed

---

## The Discord Discovery

I was venting in a Discord server about how video generation tools were failing me.

Someone mentioned: **"Have you tried lm-arena?"**

I hadn't. I didn't even know what lm-arena was properly.

**"They have Sora there."**

Wait. Sora? The same Sora I'd just tested on Fal.ai and got shit results?

**"Try it. It's different."**

---

## The lm-arena Experiment

### Same Tool, Different Platform

I tried Sora on lm-arena with **the exact same prompts** I'd used on Fal.ai.

**Results?**

**Quite different. Better.**

Not just marginally better. **Significantly** better.

Same model. Same prompts. Different platform.

**Different outputs.**

---

## Why? I Have No Idea

I genuinely don't know why this happened.

**Theories:**
- Different model versions?
- Different parameter defaults?
- Different backend processing?
- Platform-specific optimizations?
- Random variance in generation?
- Fal.ai implementation issues?
- lm-arena doing something special?

**Truth?**

**I don't know. And I stopped caring because it worked.**

---

## The Workflow That Emerged

### Multiple Accounts Strategy

lm-arena has rate limits. I needed to generate multiple clips fast.

**Solution:** Used multiple Discord friends' accounts (with permission!)

**Process:**
1. Write prompt
2. Generate on multiple accounts in parallel
3. Compare results
4. Pick best outputs
5. Iterate with variations
6. Repeat until satisfied

**Success rate:** High for parameter-specific outputs

Much better than Fal.ai's 0% success rate.

---

## What Actually Worked

### The Results

Generated multiple video clips:
- ‚úÖ 1920s aesthetic captured
- ‚úÖ Atmospheric mood achieved
- ‚úÖ Professional quality
- ‚úÖ Usable for final teaser

**Total clips generated:** ~15-20

**Clips used in final video:** 4-5

**Clips I fell in love with but didn't use:** 2 üíî

### The Process

**What made lm-arena work:**
- High success rate compared to Fal.ai
- Consistent quality
- Parameter control that actually mattered
- Parallel generation across accounts
- Quick iteration cycles

**Time spent:**
- Fal.ai experiments: Hours of failure
- lm-arena success: Much faster results

---

## The Clips I Didn't Use

This is the painful part.

There were clips I **loved**‚Äîperfect aesthetic, perfect mood, perfect vibes.

But they didn't fit the final narrative.

So they sit in my archive, unused.

**The creative chaos:** Generating more than you need because you're exploring possibilities.

**The director's job:** Choosing what serves the story, not what you fell in love with.

---

## Technical Comparison

### Fal.ai (Sora)
- ‚ùå Inconsistent results
- ‚ùå Poor quality outputs
- ‚ùå Couldn't achieve desired aesthetic
- ‚ùå Wasted budget
- ‚ùå Frustrating experience

### lm-arena (Sora)
- ‚úÖ Consistent quality
- ‚úÖ Achieved desired aesthetic
- ‚úÖ High success rate
- ‚úÖ Parameter-specific outputs worked
- ‚úÖ Parallel processing with multiple accounts

**Same tool. Different platform. Totally different experience.**

---

## The Mystery

Here's what I genuinely don't understand:

**How can the same model produce such different results on different platforms?**

Possible explanations:
1. **Model versions differ** - Maybe lm-arena has a newer/different version
2. **Implementation matters** - Platform wrapper affects outputs
3. **Parameter handling** - Different default settings or processing
4. **Backend differences** - Server-side processing varies
5. **Random variance** - Maybe I just got unlucky on Fal.ai?

**What I know for certain:**
- Same prompts
- Supposedly same model
- Radically different results

**What I learned:**
- Platform matters as much as the model
- Test tools on different platforms
- Don't assume one bad experience means the tool is bad
- Sometimes you find solutions by accident

---

## Lessons for AI Tool Usage

### 1. Platform ‚â† Model

The model name (Sora, Gemini, etc.) isn't the whole story.

**How it's implemented matters:**
- Platform wrapper
- Parameter defaults
- Processing pipeline
- Rate limiting
- Quality settings

### 2. Test Multiple Platforms

If a tool fails on one platform, try it elsewhere.

I almost gave up on Sora entirely. lm-arena saved the project.

### 3. Parallel Processing Is Power

Multiple accounts (with permission!) = faster iteration.

When you're on a deadline, this matters.

### 4. Generate More Than You Need

Creative exploration requires excess.

You won't use everything. That's okay. You're finding what works.

### 5. Budget for Experimentation

Fal.ai budget was "wasted" on failed experiments.

But without those failures, I wouldn't have found lm-arena.

**Experimentation is part of the cost.**

---

## The Final Video

All the video clips in the final teaser came from lm-arena.

**Tools:**
- **Video:** lm-arena + Sora
- **Voice:** Gemini voice generation
- **SFX:** Adobe Firefly
- **Editing:** kdenlive

**Result:** Professional-quality teaser for the murder mystery game.

**Would this exist without lm-arena?**

Maybe. But not in 1 week. And not with this quality.

---

## The Honest Take

**I don't know why lm-arena worked better than Fal.ai.**

I have theories. I have guesses. I have no definitive answer.

**What I know:**
- It worked
- It saved the video production
- Platform matters
- Testing multiple tools is worth it
- Sometimes you find solutions by accident

**What I learned:**
- Don't assume one failure means total failure
- Ask around (Discord communities are gold)
- Platform implementation matters as much as model choice
- Budget for experimentation and failure
- Generate excess, choose selectively

---

## For Other Creators

If you're struggling with AI video generation:

1. **Try multiple platforms** - Same model, different results
2. **Join communities** - Discord servers have real-time tool intel
3. **Budget for failures** - Experimentation costs money/time
4. **Parallel processing** - Multiple accounts (with permission!) speed things up
5. **Generate excess** - You need options to choose from

**And if something works but you don't know why?**

Use it anyway. Document the mystery. Move forward.

Understanding why can come later.

## What's Next

The video clips exist. The teaser is done.

But how did the rest of the production pipeline work? How did I go from video clips to a complete game?

## The Mystery Remains

**Why does lm-arena produce better Sora results than Fal.ai?**

I still don't know.

If you have theories, insights, or technical explanations‚ÄîI want to hear them.

But for now, it remains one of those things that **just worked**.

And sometimes, when you're on a 2-week deadline, "it works" is all you need. ‚ú®

**Note:** This is part of the Artifactum series documenting the creation of Christmas Murder Mystery 1926. The game will be played December 25, 2025.

lm-arena became my favorite video generation tool by accident. The best tools often are.
