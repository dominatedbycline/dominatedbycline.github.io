## Hi, I'm Maria, and I let AI convince me to make things.

What started as "let's use AI to help plan a murder mystery dinner" somehow turned into a full-scale 11-character roleplay game with custom typesetting, AI-generated promotional videos, and a git-based content management system. You know, normal stuff.

## What This Is

**Dominated by Cline** is my lab for AI-assisted chaos. I build creative projects using AI tools—not to replace the creative process, but to see what happens when you combine human ideas with computational horsepower and a questionable amount of caffeine.

This site documents:

- **The projects I build** (mystery crimes, and whatever comes next)
- **The tools I use** (Claude, HuggingFace, VS Code, Python, Typst, etc.)
- **The processes that work** (and the spectacular failures)
- **Everything in between**

## Current Focus

Right now I'm wrapping up the first **Artefactum Mystery Crime**: "Christmas Murder Dinner 1926." It's a complete murder mystery game for 11 players, and I built it in about 2 weeks using more AI tools than I can count. Future posts will break down exactly how (and why).

**Artefactum** is the name for my mystery crime game series—each one a self-contained experiment in AI-assisted creative chaos.

## The Philosophy

AI is a collaborator, not a replacement. The weird ideas are mine. The execution is assisted. The learning is documented. The bloopers are included.

Think of it like this: I'm the director, AI is the extremely capable (and occasionally overzealous) production team. The final product is always a collaboration, and I document every step—including when the production team suggests something ridiculous.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Project showcases** with full breakdowns
- **Tool experiments** and comparisons
- **Process documentation** from concept to completion
- **Tutorials** for reusable workflows
- **Bloopers** because learning happens in the failures
- **Code and templates** you can actually use
