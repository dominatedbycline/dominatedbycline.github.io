## Who I am

I'm Marilu â€” an interior designer who fell down the AI rabbit hole and never looked back.

I started in interior design because I love creating spaces that tell stories. But here's the thing: my ADHD brain craves constant stimulation, and interior design, as much as I love it, felt... incomplete. Too narrow. I needed more.

**Enter AI.**

With AI, I can do a bit of everything. Design, code, write, create games, plan events, build experiences. I get to learn constantly â€” "pra xuxu" as I say â€” and that's exactly what my brain needs.

## What I'm building

Right now, I'm exploring how AI can transform event planning and interactive experiences. My first major project is **Murder Mystery 1926**, part of a series I'm calling **Artifactum** â€” AI-generated crime mysteries that people can actually play.

I'm also planning a wedding for 2027 (yes, really) and using AI methods to do it. Because why not turn life's big moments into creative experiments?

## What I've learned

This journey has been messy, chaotic, and absolutely incredible. I've learned so much from building the Murder Mystery project â€” about AI tools, game design, storytelling, and how to make weird ideas actually work.

None of this would be possible without my friend and collaborator, Nobody, who's been teaching me, supporting me, and pushing me to try things I didn't think I could do. ðŸ’™

## What's next

More projects. More experiments. More events, games, planning adventures, and whatever else catches my attention.

This site is where I document it all â€” the successes, the failures, the "what was I thinking" moments, and everything I learn along the way.

If you want to follow along, collaborate, or just say hi, find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/marialu1).
