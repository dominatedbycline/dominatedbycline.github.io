## About Artefactum

**Artefactum** is a blog documenting experiments with AI tools, programming workflows, and creative processes. The name comes from the Latin word for "artifact"‚Äîsomething crafted with skill.

This blog focuses on:

- **AI-assisted workflows** for creative projects
- **Programming techniques** (Python, Typst, automation)
- **Process documentation** from concept to completion
- **Bloopers & learnings** along the way

## Why This Blog Exists

AI tools are evolving rapidly, but understanding *how* to use them effectively‚Äîand documenting what works‚Äîis just as important as the final product.

This blog shares:

- ‚úÖ **What worked** (with code and templates)
- ‚ùå **What failed** (and what I learned)
- üîß **Reusable workflows** for similar projects
- üé® **The creative process**, not just polished results

## Featured Project: Christmas Murder Dinner 1926

The inaugural featured project is a complete murder mystery roleplay game for 11 players set in 1920s Manhattan. This project showcases:

- AI-assisted character development (analyzing 11 interconnected characters)
- Automated typesetting with Typst
- Modular content architecture (snippet-based version control)
- AI-generated video assets via HuggingFace
- Workflow automation (git hooks, build scripts)

Future posts will break down each technique with code examples and reusable templates.
