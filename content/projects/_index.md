Welcome to the project showcase. Each project here is an experiment in AI-assisted creation—from concept to completion, including all the weird decisions and spectacular failures along the way.

## Current Projects

### Artifactum Mystery Crimes

**Murder, Mayhem, and Machine Learning**

**Artefactum** is my series of murder mystery roleplay games—each one a complete, self-contained experiment in AI-assisted creative chaos. The name comes from the Latin word for "artifact": something crafted with skill.

Each game in the series is built using AI tools as creative collaborators, with full documentation of the process, tools, and inevitable bloopers.

**Status:** First game complete  
**Tags:** #ai-tools #creative #game-design #typst #python

**The Mission:** Navigate the European AI creative tech job market, identify the perfect role matches, and develop a concrete 90-day action plan—all while turning an "unconventional" background into a competitive advantage.
