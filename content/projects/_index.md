# Artifactum Mystery Crimes

## Murder, Mayhem, and Machine Learning

**Artefactum** is my series of murder mystery roleplay games—each one a complete, self-contained experiment in AI-assisted creative chaos. The name comes from the Latin word for "artifact": something crafted with skill.

Each game in the series is built using AI tools as creative collaborators, with full documentation of the process, tools, and inevitable bloopers.
