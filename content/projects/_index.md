Welcome to the project showcase. Each project here is an experiment in AI-assisted creation—from concept to completion, including all the weird decisions and spectacular failures along the way.

## Current Projects

### The Pantheon Portfolio

**A mythological journey through my work.**

An interactive portfolio designed as a Greek temple with four chambers, each dedicated to a different god and a different facet of my work and personality. This isn't just a portfolio; it's an experience.

**Status:** In Development 🚧
**Tags:** #nextjs #react #tailwindcss #threejs #ai #portfolio

### Artifactum Mystery Crimes

**Murder, Mayhem, and Machine Learning**

**Artefactum** is my series of murder mystery roleplay games—each one a complete, self-contained experiment in AI-assisted creative chaos. The name comes from the Latin word for "artifact": something crafted with skill.

Each game in the series is built using AI tools as creative collaborators, with full documentation of the process, tools, and inevitable bloopers.

**Status:** First game complete  
**Tags:** #ai-tools #creative #game-design #typst #python

### Strategic Job Search

**From Interior Designer to AI Creative Technologist**

A comprehensive, AI-powered career transition research report documenting my path from traditional creative work into the emerging field of AI creative technology. This is what happens when you use Claude to conduct strategic market research for your own career pivot.

**The Mission:** Navigate the European AI creative tech job market, identify the perfect role matches, and develop a concrete 90-day action plan—all while turning an "unconventional" background into a competitive advantage.

**Status:** Research complete, execution in progress

### Building This Site

**From "I Don't Understand Shit" to Actually Shipping It**

Meta-documentation of building this very site you're reading. A journey from Squarespace frustration to Hugo mastery, documenting every confused moment, broken build, and eventual breakthrough. Proof that you can learn web development even when you start with zero idea what you're doing.

**The Reality:** I tried Squarespace first, got frustrated with the limitations, discovered Hugo, and learned static site generation through AI-assisted trial and error. This site is the result—and the documentation of how it got built is now part of the portfolio itself.

**Status:** Live and continuously evolving  
**Tags:** #hugo #web-development #learning #static-sites #github-pages
