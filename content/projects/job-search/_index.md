# Strategic Job Search

## From Interior Designer to AI Creative Technologist

This is my strategic job search analysis—a comprehensive research report created with AI assistance to navigate my career transition from interior design into AI creative technology.

**The Challenge:** How do you transition from a traditional creative field into an emerging AI-powered discipline? What roles exist? Which companies are hiring? How do you position yourself when you don't fit conventional categories?

**The Solution:** I used AI tools (primarily Claude) to conduct deep market research, analyze the European job landscape, and develop a strategic 90-day action plan.
