## Murder, Mayhem, and Machine Learning

**Artefactum** is my series of murder mystery roleplay games—each one a complete, self-contained experiment in AI-assisted creative chaos. The name comes from the Latin word for "artifact": something crafted with skill.

Each game in the series is built using AI tools as creative collaborators, with full documentation of the process, tools, and inevitable bloopers.

## Christmas Murder Dinner 1926

**Status:** Complete ✅  
**Players:** 11 characters  
**Setting:** 1920s Manhattan  
**Development Time:** ~2 weeks  
**AI Tools Used:** Too many to count

### What It Is

A complete murder mystery roleplay game for 11 players set in 1920s Manhattan. Players receive character sheets, backstories, secrets, and objectives. Someone gets murdered. Chaos ensues. The game includes:

- 11 fully developed interconnected characters
- 100+ pages of character sheets and game materials
- Custom typesetting and design
- AI-generated promotional assets
- Modular content architecture for version control

### How It Was Built

This project showcases:

- **AI-assisted character development** - Using Claude to analyze character relationships and ensure narrative consistency across 11 interconnected backstories
- **Automated typesetting with Typst** - Replacing LaTeX with a modern, faster alternative for document generation
- **Modular content architecture** - Snippet-based character sheets with git version control
- **AI-generated video assets** - Promotional materials created via HuggingFace
- **Workflow automation** - Git hooks, build scripts, and Python automation
- **Everything in between** - Including the parts where nothing worked

### The Process (Coming Soon)

Future blog posts will break down each technique with code examples, tool comparisons, and reusable templates:

- From concept to playable game in 2 weeks
- Character development workflow with AI
- Automated typesetting systems
- Content architecture for creative projects
- AI asset generation pipeline
- Bloopers: What went spectacularly wrong

## What's Next

More mystery crimes are coming. Each one will be a new experiment with different tools, techniques, and creative challenges.

The goal isn't perfection—it's exploration, documentation, and learning.
