# EventFlow - AI-Powered Event Planning Platform

**Status:** üî® In Development (95% complete, currently testing)
**Timeline:** 1 week of intensive building
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, SQLite, Gradio, AI Integration, Telegram Bots
**Nature:** Real production project, not a tutorial exercise

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Full Transparency

**This is not a finished product showcase.**

This is documentation of a **real build process**‚Äîmessy, complex, and ongoing. I'm building in public because:
- The learning is more valuable than a perfect demo
- The challenges are as interesting as the solutions
- Honest progress beats polished lies

**What's working:** Most features are functional and being tested
**What's left:** Final polish, deployment, comprehensive testing
**What I learned:** More than I expected. Way more.

## How This Started

A friend asked me to help organize her wedding.

I looked at existing event planning tools. They were either:
- Too expensive
- Too complicated
- Too generic
- Not smart enough

**The moment:** "I could build something better."

After the [murder mystery game](/projects/artifactum/murder-mystery-1926/), I had the confidence. After learning FastAPI and AI integration, I had the tools.

**The decision:** Build a real event planning platform. For my friend's wedding. And for anyone else who needs it.

### The Research Phase

**I spent a full day researching before writing any code.**

This wasn't tutorial-following. This was deep market analysis with Claude:
- Analyzed existing event planning tools (tested 5+ platforms)
- Discovered the real pain point: **Guest list management takes 20-30 hours per event**
- Evaluated tech stacks (Next.js + Supabase vs FastAPI + SQLite)
- Researched AI agent frameworks (Smolagents vs alternatives)
- Planned database architecture (SQLite MVP ‚Üí PostgreSQL production)
- Studied production deployment patterns

**The Decision:** FastAPI. Play to my Python strengths. Ship in 1 week, not 6 weeks.

**The Documentation:** Everything saved in research docs (`idea-seed.md`, `mvp-refs.md`)

**Read the full research process:**
- üìö [The Research Phase - Market Analysis & Planning](/posts/eventflow-research-phase/)
- üõ†Ô∏è [Why FastAPI Over Next.js - Tech Stack Decision](/posts/eventflow-tech-stack-decision/)

**The Goal:** Build something real. Learn deeply. Ship properly.

### Why EventFlow?

Event planning is:
- **Complex enough** to be interesting
- **Simple enough** to understand
- **Real-world** useful (I actually need this)
- **AI-friendly** (lots of opportunities for smart features)

Perfect learning project.

## Building This Wasn't Solo Work

### Nobody: The Architecture Guru üíô

**Nobody was crucial to this project.** I had:
- The idea
- The energy
- The determination to build it properly

**But I didn't have:**
- Deep knowledge of FastAPI architecture
- Understanding of which tools to use (open source vs paid)
- Database design expertise
- Telegram bot implementation patterns
- Production deployment best practices

**Nobody provided:**
- Initial architecture guidance
- Tool recommendations and comparisons
- Database schema design help
- Best practices I would have missed
- Real-world production insights

**Critical point:** Nobody helped me avoid building something that "works" but is a mess underneath.

### AI Tools: The Building Assistants

**Claude Code** was the development workhorse:
- Wrote most of the actual code
- Debugged issues rapidly
- Implemented features from specifications
- Iterated quickly on feedback

**Claude** helped with:
- Planning and architecture discussions
- Understanding complex concepts
- Problem-solving when stuck
- Documentation and explanations

### My Role: The Director

**I brought:**
- The vision of what to build
- Product decisions and feature choices
- Relentless iteration and testing
- The "this needs to work properly" mindset
- User experience thinking
- Willingness to rebuild when needed

**The collaboration:**
```
Nobody's expertise ‚Üí My vision ‚Üí AI tools execution ‚Üí Real product
```

**The Modular Approach:**
```
backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events.py      # Event management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.py       # Task system
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vendors.py     # Vendor marketplace
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ guests.py      # Guest management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py          # Database models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas.py         # Pydantic schemas
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py            # FastAPI app
```

Clean separation. Each feature is independent. Easy to maintain.

<summary><h2 class="inline-heading">The Delicious Process</h2></summary>

## Why This Was (Is) Delicious

### The Learning

**FastAPI:** Started knowing nothing. Now comfortable building production APIs.

**Database Design:** Learned about relationships, foreign keys, migrations, normalization.

**AI Integration:** From "how do I call an API?" to building a 47-tool AI agent system.

**Full-Stack Thinking:** Understanding how backend, frontend, database, and AI fit together.

### The Challenges (The Fun Part)

**Database Migrations:**
- Learned the hard way about schema changes
- Wrote 4+ migration scripts
- Now understand why tools like Alembic exist

**AI Tool Refresh:**
- Built auto-refresh system so I could add tools without restarting
- Learned about Python's `importlib.reload()`
- Made development SO much faster

**Telegram Bot Architecture:**
- First time building a bot
- Learned about webhooks vs polling
- Implemented memory system for context

**Testing Everything:**
- Created comprehensive testing checklist
- Learning to think about edge cases
- Understanding user flows

### The Surprises

**Good Surprises:**
- FastAPI is amazing (seriously, the docs auto-generation!)
- Gradio makes UI prototyping trivial
- AI agents are more capable than expected
- The modular architecture made changes easy

**Challenging Surprises:**
- Database relationships are tricky
- State management in Telegram bots is complex

## The Reality Check

### What Worked

‚úÖ **Modular architecture** - Easy to add features
‚úÖ **FastAPI** - Incredible developer experience
‚úÖ **AI integration** - More powerful than expected
‚úÖ **Gradio** - Perfect for rapid prototyping
‚úÖ **Nobody's guidance** - Saved months of mistakes
‚úÖ **Building in public** - Keeps me honest

### What Was Hard

‚ùå **Database design** - More complex than anticipated
‚ùå **State management** - Especially in Telegram bot
‚ùå **Testing** - Takes MUCH longer than building
‚ùå **Scope creep** - So many "just one more feature" moments
‚ùå **Polish** - Making it "production ready" is harder than making it work

### What I'd Do Differently

1. **Start with testing** - Should have written tests from day one
2. **Better database planning** - Migrations are painful
3. **Simpler UI first** - Gradio was great but limiting
4. **More user testing** - Testing my own workflow isn't enough
5. **Clearer milestones** - "95% done" has been true for a week üòÖ

## Want to Follow This Journey?

**This project is ongoing.** I'll document:
- Testing discoveries
- Deployment challenges
- Feature additions
- Learning breakthroughs

**Follow:** [#eventflow](/tags/eventflow/) for updates

**The Code:** Available on request (considering open-sourcing parts)

---

## The Truth

**Is this done?** No.

**Will it ever be "done"?** Real products are never done.

**Is it useful?** Already using it to plan events.

**Did I learn a ton?** Absolutely.

**Was it worth it?** 100%.
