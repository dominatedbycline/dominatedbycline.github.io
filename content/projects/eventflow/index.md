# EventFlow - AI-Powered Event Planning Platform

**Status:** üî® In Development (95% complete, currently testing)
**Timeline:** 1 week of intensive building
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, SQLite, Gradio, AI Integration, Telegram Bots
**Nature:** Real production project, not a tutorial exercise

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Full Transparency

**This is not a finished product showcase.**

This is documentation of a **real build process**‚Äîmessy, complex, and ongoing. I'm building in public because:
- The learning is more valuable than a perfect demo
- The challenges are as interesting as the solutions
- Honest progress beats polished lies

**What's working:** Most features are functional and being tested
**What's left:** Final polish, deployment, comprehensive testing
**What I learned:** More than I expected. Way more.

## How This Started

A friend asked me to help organize her wedding.

I looked at existing event planning tools. They were either:
- Too expensive
- Too complicated
- Too generic
- Not smart enough

**The moment:** "I could build something better."

After the [murder mystery game](/projects/artifactum/murder-mystery-1926/), I had the confidence. After learning FastAPI and AI integration, I had the tools.

**The decision:** Build a real event planning platform. For my friend's wedding. And for anyone else who needs it.

### The Research Phase: One Full Day Before Any Code

**The Problem I Discovered:**

Professional event planners spend **20-30 hours per event** just on guest list management. This is insane. Manual work, spreadsheets, endless emails, tracking RSVPs, dietary restrictions, plus-ones, check-ins.

**Market Analysis - What Already Exists:**

**The Expensive Ones** ($100-300/month):
- Full-featured but over-complicated
- Designed for enterprise, not flexible
- More time managing the tool than planning events

**The Simple Ones:**
- Easy but lack depth
- No AI, no automation
- Just digitized spreadsheets

**The Generic Ones:**
- Try to do everything (project management + events)
- Not specialized for event planners' workflows

**The Gap:** A tool that's **complex under the hood but simple to use** + **AI-powered to eliminate manual work**.

**The MVP Strategy - 3 Priority Levels:**

**üî¥ LEVEL 1: CORE (Must Have First)**
- Event management (CRUD operations)
- Guest list with RSVP system (solve the 20-30h problem!)
- Basic dashboard

**Why Start Here:** If I solve guest list management brilliantly, planners will save 20-30 hours per event. That's the hook.

**üü° LEVEL 2: DIFFERENTIATORS**
- Vendor management (LinkedIn-style profiles)
- Budget tracking (estimated vs real, alerts)
- Task/timeline management (deadlines, assignments)

**üü¢ LEVEL 3: WOW FACTOR**
- AI-powered vendor recommendations
- Automated timeline generation
- Smart suggestions based on event type
- Chatbot for guest FAQs

**The Tech Stack Decision:**

**Path A: Next.js + Supabase**
- Pros: Popular, great tutorials, fast prototyping
- Cons: Learning React + Next.js + TypeScript from scratch
- Estimated MVP: 4-6 weeks

**Path B: FastAPI + SQLite + Gradio**
- Pros: I already know Python, FastAPI is fast, Gradio prototypes UI instantly
- Cons: Not trendy, will need to replace Gradio later
- Estimated MVP: 1-2 weeks

**My Decision:** FastAPI. Play to my strengths. Ship in 1 week, not 6 weeks. Replace Gradio with React later if needed.

**The Full Stack Chosen:**
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite (‚Üí PostgreSQL for production)
- Frontend: Gradio (rapid prototyping, replace later)
- AI: Groq API (GPT-OSS-120B) + Smolagents framework
- Telegram: Python-telegram-bot for Caroline AI
- Database: SQLite with Alembic migrations (easy PostgreSQL migration)

**Research Resources Created:**
- `idea-seed.md` - Full market analysis, MVP planning, stack comparison
- `mvp-refs.md` - Technical deep dive: Smolagents patterns, FastAPI production, PostgreSQL migration, Docker deployment, authentication

**The Timeline:**
- Day 1: Research + planning with Claude
- Days 2-7: Building (shipped 95% of features)

### Why EventFlow?

Event planning is:
- **Complex enough** to be interesting
- **Simple enough** to understand
- **Real-world** useful (I actually need this)
- **AI-friendly** (lots of opportunities for smart features)

Perfect learning project.

<summary><h2 class="inline-heading">The Delicious Process</h2></summary>

## Why This Was (Is) Delicious

### The Learning

**FastAPI:** Started knowing nothing. Now comfortable building production APIs.

**Database Design:** Learned about relationships, foreign keys, migrations, normalization.

**AI Integration:** From "how do I call an API?" to building a 47-tool AI agent system.

**Full-Stack Thinking:** Understanding how backend, frontend, database, and AI fit together.

### The Challenges (The Fun Part)

**Database Migrations:**
- Learned the hard way about schema changes
- Wrote 4+ migration scripts
- Now understand why tools like Alembic exist

**AI Tool Refresh:**
- Built auto-refresh system so I could add tools without restarting
- Learned about Python's `importlib.reload()`
- Made development SO much faster

**Telegram Bot Architecture:**
- First time building a bot
- Learned about webhooks vs polling
- Implemented memory system for context

**Testing Everything:**
- Created comprehensive testing checklist
- Learning to think about edge cases
- Understanding user flows

### The Surprises

**Good Surprises:**
- FastAPI is amazing (seriously, the docs auto-generation!)
- Gradio makes UI prototyping trivial
- AI agents are more capable than expected
- The modular architecture made changes easy

**Challenging Surprises:**
- Database relationships are tricky
- State management in Telegram bots is complex
- Testing takes longer than building
- Production deployment is its own project

### The "Aha!" Moments

1. **Understanding REST API design:** It clicked when I structured the vendor marketplace
2. **Database normalization:** Finally got why foreign keys matter
3. **AI tool composition:** Realized agents are just well-structured function calls
4. **Testing importance:** Found bugs I would have NEVER caught without systematic testing

## The Real Education

### Technical Skills

**Backend Development:**
- RESTful API design
- Database schema design
- ORM usage (SQLAlchemy)
- API authentication (upcoming)
- Error handling and validation

**Frontend Development:**
- Server-side rendering
- Responsive design
- Data visualization
- User experience thinking

**AI Integration:**
- LLM API usage
- Agent frameworks (Smolagents)
- Tool composition
- Context management
- Prompt engineering

**DevOps (Learning):**

### Product Thinking

- **Scope management:** What's MVP vs nice-to-have
- **User flows:** How people actually use software
- **Edge cases:** All the ways things can break
- **Testing:** Why it matters and how to do it properly

### Process Lessons

1. **Architecture matters:** Good structure makes changes easy
   - Modular FastAPI structure meant adding vendors/meetings/analytics was simple
   - Nobody's guidance on proper structure saved weeks of refactoring

2. **Testing saves time:** Finding bugs early is cheaper
   - Should have written tests from day 1 (learning this the hard way)
   - Current phase: comprehensive testing revealing edge cases I'd never find otherwise

3. **Documentation helps:** Future-you will thank present-you
   - Research seeds (`idea-seed.md`, `mvp-refs.md`) saved me when stuck
   - API auto-docs from FastAPI are lifesavers

4. **Iteration works:** Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Improve
   - Gradio ‚Üí React (planned): frontend can be replaced independently
   - SQLite ‚Üí PostgreSQL: database migration path clear from day 1
   - Don't over-engineer early, but plan the upgrade path

5. **Collaboration amplifies:** Nobody + AI + Me > Me alone
   - Nobody: Architecture wisdom I didn't have
   - Claude Code: Implementation speed (47 tools built fast)
   - Me: Vision, product decisions, relentless iteration

### Concrete Technical Learnings

**Database Design:**
- Foreign keys prevent orphaned data
- Migrations with Alembic = no data loss on schema changes
- Normalization vs denormalization trade-offs
- Soft deletes > hard deletes (keep audit trail)

**AI Agent Patterns:**
- CodeAgent > ToolCallingAgent (30% fewer steps, more expressive)
- Structured returns (dict/list) > string parsing
- Temperature 0.3-0.5 = reliable but not robotic
- Planning interval prevents agent from getting lost

**FastAPI Production:**
- Dependency injection for database sessions
- Pydantic schemas catch bugs at request time
- Background tasks for async operations
- Health checks for monitoring

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Docker Compose for local development
- Environment variables for all secrets (.env file, never commit)
- Nginx for SSL and reverse proxy
- PostgreSQL connection pooling for performance

```

**Gradio MCP Server:**
- `mcp_server=True` enables both web UI AND MCP server
- Chat interface built-in (perfect for AI assistant)
- 20 lines of code = full chat UI

### AI & Integration
```python
groq==0.4.1             # Groq API client (GPT-OSS-120B)
litellm==1.17.0         # Multi-LLM interface
smolagents==0.1.0       # Agent framework (HuggingFace)
python-telegram-bot     # Telegram integration
```

**Smolagents Architecture Decisions:**
- **CodeAgent** (not ToolCallingAgent) - more expressive, 30% fewer steps
- Structured tool returns (dict/list, not strings)
- Temperature 0.3-0.5 for reliability
- Planning interval every 3 steps for complex tasks
- 47+ tools for complete event management

**Tool Design Pattern:**
```python
@tool
def create_event(name: str, date: str, venue: str) -> dict:
    """
    Creates a new event in the system.

    Args:
        name: Event name (max 100 chars)
        date: ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
        venue: Full venue address or name

    Returns:
        dict: Created event with id, name, date, status
    """
    # Implementation with error handling
    return {"success": True, "data": result}
```

### Database Architecture
- **SQLite** (development) - zero setup, perfect for iterating
- **Alembic** migrations from day 1 (clean schema changes)
- Migration path to **PostgreSQL** (production)
- **SQLAlchemy** ORM (same code works with both databases)

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Foreign key relationships (events ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí vendors)
- Proper normalization (no data duplication)
- Index on frequently queried fields
- Soft deletes (keep history)

### Development Tools
```bash
Git                     # Version control
VSCode + Claude Code    # Development environment
Pytest                  # Testing framework (not used enough yet!)
Alembic                 # Database migrations
```

### Production Deployment Plan

**Docker Compose Architecture:**
```yaml
services:
  postgres:     # PostgreSQL database
  backend:      # FastAPI (4 workers)
  frontend:     # Gradio UI
  nginx:        # Reverse proxy + SSL
```

**Stack Considered:**
- Railway.app (easiest, automatic PostgreSQL)
- Fly.io (global edge, great free tier)
- DigitalOcean App Platform (balanced)
- AWS ECS + RDS (most scalable, more complex)

**Security & Production Readiness:**
- JWT authentication (planned)
- Environment variables for all secrets
- Health check endpoints
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- PostgreSQL connection pooling
- Automated backups

## The Reality Check

### What Worked

‚úÖ **Modular architecture** - Easy to add features
‚úÖ **FastAPI** - Incredible developer experience
‚úÖ **AI integration** - More powerful than expected
‚úÖ **Gradio** - Perfect for rapid prototyping
‚úÖ **Nobody's guidance** - Saved months of mistakes
‚úÖ **Building in public** - Keeps me honest

### What Was Hard

‚ùå **Database design** - More complex than anticipated
‚ùå **State management** - Especially in Telegram bot
‚ùå **Testing** - Takes MUCH longer than building
‚ùå **Scope creep** - So many "just one more feature" moments
‚ùå **Polish** - Making it "production ready" is harder than making it work

### What I'd Do Differently

1. **Start with testing** - Should have written tests from day one
2. **Better database planning** - Migrations are painful
3. **Simpler UI first** - Gradio was great but limiting
4. **More user testing** - Testing my own workflow isn't enough
5. **Clearer milestones** - "95% done" has been true for a week üòÖ
