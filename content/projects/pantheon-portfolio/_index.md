# 🏛️ The Pantheon - An Interactive Portfolio

**The Big Idea:** What if a portfolio wasn't just a list of projects, but an experience? A journey?

That's the question that sparked The Pantheon. It's an interactive portfolio designed as a Greek temple with four chambers, each dedicated to a different god and a different facet of my work and personality.

- **⚔️ Athena's Chamber (Tech & AI):** Wisdom, strategy, and pure, unadulterated code.
- **💖 Aphrodite's Gallery (Design):** Beauty, aesthetics, and all things visually pleasing.
- **🍷 Dionysus' Theatre (Creative):** Chaos, celebration, and my wildest creative experiments.
- **☀️ Apollo's Hall (Career):** Order, growth, and the story of my professional journey.

This isn't just a portfolio; it's a statement. It's proof that you can blend technical skill with creative storytelling to build something truly unique.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **3D (Coming Soon):** React Three Fiber, Three.js, GSAP for animations
- **AI (Planned):** Groq API, RAG with a vector DB, and four personality-based chatbots (one for each god, of course).

## 🚀 The Journey So Far

- **The Foundation:** Built with a modern, type-safe stack.
- **The Structure:** The four-chamber system is in place.
- **The Content:** Athena's chamber is fully stocked with my latest tech projects.

## 🚧 What's Next

- **The Grand Entrance:** A 3D entrance with portals to each chamber.
- **The Finishing Touches:** Populating the remaining three chambers.
- **The Gods Themselves:** Integrating the AI chatbots to guide visitors through the experience.

This project is a living, breathing thing, and I'm building it in public, one commit at a time. Come on in and explore.
