# The Artefactum App: The AI Engine Behind the Mystery

Every story needs a storyteller. For the Artifactum Mystery Crimes series, that storyteller is an app.

This isn't just a game; it's a platform. The Artefactum App is the AI-powered engine I built to generate, manage, and run the murder mystery experiences. Think of it as a "Mystery in a Box" toolkit, but the box is powered by advanced AI and a whole lot of Python.

## 🤖 What It Does

The app is the central nervous system for each mystery. It's responsible for:

- **Character Generation:** Crafting unique characters with backstories, secrets, and motivations.
- **Clue Management:** Distributing clues to the right characters at the right time.
- **Plot Weaving:** Weaving a tangled web of relationships and events that leads to the final reveal.
- **Real-time Interaction:** (Coming Soon) Allowing players to interact with the game world and non-player characters through a simple interface.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (The Bones of the Beast)

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI (because it's fast, modern, and I love it).
- **AI:** A custom-built pipeline using multiple LLMs for different tasks—one for creative writing, one for logical consistency, and one for character voice.
- **Database:** SQLite (for now), because it's simple, reliable, and perfect for this stage of development.

## 🚀 The Vision

The goal is to create a reusable platform that can generate endless mystery scenarios. I want to be able to plug in a new theme, a new setting, or a new set of characters and have the app spit out a fully-playable game.

It's an ambitious project, but that's what makes it fun. This is where the magic happens, folks. This is the engine of the mystery.
