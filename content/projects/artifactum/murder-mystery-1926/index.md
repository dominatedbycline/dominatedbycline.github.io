<summary><h2 style="display: inline;">The Origin Story</h2></summary>

It started on a beach.

I was stuck. No prospects. Feeling creatively blocked. Nobody (my personal Cri-Kee ðŸ’™) suggestedâ€”againâ€”that I try AI.

"But it can't be creative," I said.

<img src="/images/innocent-as-a-babydog.png" alt="innocent dog" style="width: 150px; display: block; margin: 1rem 0;" />
<p style="font-size: 0.85rem; font-style: italic; margin-top: -0.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">(me innocent as a baby dog)(yodo)</p>

**Well. Guess not.**

A few weeks earlier, I'd seen an Instagram reel from a creative director who made a murder mystery party for her friends. I loved it. I wanted to make one too.

<img src="/images/instagram-inspo.jpg" alt="Instagram inspiration" style="max-width: 200px; display: block; margin: 1rem 0;" />
<p style="font-size: 0.85rem; font-style: italic; margin-top: -0.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Insta:viktoria.psd</p>

My sister hosts a Christmas dinner every year with friends. I suggested we do a murder mystery this year instead.

10 people signed up.

<img src="/images/burning-in-hell.png" alt="burning in hell" style="width: 150px; display: block; margin: 1rem 0;" />

So I had 2 weeks to make an 11-character murder mystery roleplay game from scratch.

With AI as my production team.

**Spoiler:** It worked. ðŸŽ­

### Week 1: Character Development & Story Architecture

Claude became the mastermind behind this projectâ€”the creative collaborator that feeds my ideas and helps them evolve.

{{< claude-carousel >}}

- Started with character concepts and relationships
- Developed 11 interconnected backstories with secret connections
- Created plot threads that weave between characters
- Multiple iterations to ensure narrative coherence
- Claude analyzed consistency across all character arcs

### Week 2: Production Pipeline

With characters locked, it was time to build everything.

### The Mastermind: Claude

Claude was the creative engine behind this entire project. Not just a toolâ€”a collaborator that:
- Helped develop and refine 11 interconnected character arcs
- Analyzed narrative consistency across backstories
- Evolved ideas from vague concepts to concrete plots
- Fed my creativity instead of replacing it

---

### Character Portraits: Gemini

<img src="/images/gemini-interface.png" alt="Gemini interface for character generation" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;" />

**Image Generation:**
- Prompt + reference photo â†’ character portraits
- Multiple iterations per character
- Style consistency across all 11 characters

<img src="/images/guest-list.png" alt="Grid of all 11 character portraits" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;" />

</details>

**Voice Generation:**
- Script-to-voice for audio clips
- Character-specific variations
- Multiple takes for selection

---

### Video Production: The lm-arena Experience

**The Discovery:**

I had budget on Fal.ai and tried MANY programs, including Sora. Results? Always shit.

**Then I tried lm-arena with Sora.**

Same tool. Different platform. **Quite different. Better.**

Why? I don't know. But lm-arena became my favorite video generation tool.

<img src="/images/smiley-baby.png" alt="Smiley baby" style="width: 150px; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;" />

**The Process:**
- Used multiple accounts (thanks Discord friends!)
- Generated multiple video clips in parallel
- High success rate for parameter-specific outputs
- Created several clips, fell in love with one I didn't even use
- Final editing in kdenlive

**Sound Design:**
- SFX created with Adobe Firefly
- Audio clips from Gemini voice generation
- Final mix in kdenlive

<img src="/images/kdenlive.png" alt="Kdenlive timeline" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;" />

### The Development Backbone: Cline (VS Code)

<img src="/images/vs-code-backbone.png" alt="VS Code with Cline interface" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;" />

ðŸ’™ **You have my heart.**

Cline was the AI coding assistant that made the entire automation pipeline possible. From Python scripts to Git hooks to content assemblyâ€”Cline was the development backbone of this project.

Without Cline, none of the automation would have happened.

### Design & Assets: Canva Pro

<img src="/images/canva-window.png" alt="Canva Pro interface with project assets" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;" />

**Props & Visual Assets:**
- All physical props and visual assets designed in Canva Pro
- Character cards, invitations, promotional materials
- Print-ready designs for game materials
- Quick iterations and professional results

**(photo: finished Canva designs - character cards, invitations, props)**

### Typesetting & Automation

**Typst** (replaced LaTeX):
- Faster, modern typesetting system
- Automated character sheet generation
- Template-based modular content
- 100+ pages generated from snippets

<div style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0.5rem auto;">

    style D fill:#95E1D3
```

</div>

**Python + Git:**
- Build automation scripts
- Git hooks for version control
- Modular content architecture
- Automated assembly pipeline

### The Privileged Setup

This project was created with access to:
- Premium AI tool subscriptions
- Fal.ai budget for experimentation
- Friends' accounts for parallel processing
- ADHD-friendly workflow (no forced breaks, continuous iteration)

This is a privileged setup. It matters to document that reality.

**Work Distribution:**

```mermaid
pie title AI vs Human Work Split
    "AI Generation" : 40
    "Human Curation" : 25
    "Human Refinement" : 20
    "Manual Work" : 15
```

---

### The Work: Hyperfocus Mode Activated

**(photo: workspace at 3am - coffee cups, chaos, screens everywhere)**

**14+ hours per day. Non-stop. Super hyperfocused.**

Not braggingâ€”just the reality of ADHD hyperfocus when the right project hits.

**(meme: person typing intensely ou "hyperfocus activated" energy)**

When you're in the zone, you don't stop. You learn by doing. You iterate constantly. You make mistakes and fix them immediately. You generate more content than you need because you're exploring every possibility.

**(photo: sleep tracker showing 4 hours ou coffee count chart)**

This project was built in that state. It's a privileged position to be able to work like that, but it's also how the learning happened.

---

### The Creative Chaos

**(graphic: "The Chaos" section header)**

- Tested MANY tools on Fal.ai before finding what worked
- Generated more content than I needed
- Fell in love with video clips I didn't use
- Learned an insane amount in 2 weeks
- Nobody's suggestion paid off (he was right, again)

**(meme: "Well well well, how the turntables" ou Nobody being smug as Cri-Kee)**

<summary><h2 style="display: inline;">What Worked</h2></summary>

**(graphic: checklist aesthetic)**

âœ… **Claude as creative collaborator** - Feeds creativity, doesn't replace it  
âœ… **Cline for development** - Made automation pipeline possible  
âœ… **lm-arena for video** - Better results than standalone tools  
âœ… **Gemini for character images** - Prompt + photo = consistent portraits  
âœ… **Adobe Firefly for SFX** - Professional audio without a sound designer  
âœ… **Typst over LaTeX** - Faster, easier automation  
âœ… **Git for creative projects** - Version control for storytelling  
âœ… **Modular content architecture** - Easy iterations and updates

<details>
<summary><h2 style="display: inline;">What I Learned</h2></summary>

**(graphic: "The Lesson" ou lightbulb moment)**

**"AI can't be creative"** â†’ Wrong. AI can be an incredible creative collaborator.

**(meme: "I was wrong" admission ou character development arc)**

But it's not about the AI replacing you. It's about the AI feeding your ideas, helping them evolve, and handling the production work while you stay in creative control.

Claude was the mastermind. Cline was the builder. I was the director. The game was the result.
