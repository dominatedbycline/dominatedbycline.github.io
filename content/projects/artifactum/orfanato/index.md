# Orfanato Nossa Senhora das Dores

**Status:** In Development 🚧
**Format:** Hybrid (physical box + companion app)
**Players:** 4-10 (cooperative)
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Language:** Portuguese

## The Concept

Three nuns are found dead at 03:33 AM—each killed in a different way, in different locations, at the exact same moment. As investigators, players must piece together impossible evidence that defies logic.

The deeper they dig, the darker the truth becomes: these weren't innocent victims. The orphanage hides decades of child abuse, and the killers... aren't human.

**Core tension:** All evidence is physically impossible. No single person could have done this. The solution requires accepting the supernatural.

---

## What Makes This Different

### Hybrid Physical + Digital
- **Physical:** A box with locked compartments, documents, photographs, evidence to pin on a cork board with red string (detective style)
- **Digital:** Companion app with videos, historical records, and the darkest secrets

### Self-Running
No game master needed. The game guides itself through locked phases—each unlock reveals new evidence and deeper horror.

### Deduction Over Discovery
Players aren't told "it was ghosts." They must deduce the supernatural through logical elimination of all human possibilities.

## Game Structure

```
THE BOX
│
├─ Setup Layer (open)
│  └─ Cork board, pins, string, floor plan, QR to start
│
├─ INTRO VIDEO → Question → Unlock Phase 1
│
├─ Phase 1: CRIME SCENE (locked)
│  └─ Autopsies, scene photos, impossibilities emerge
│
├─ Phase 2: TESTIMONIES (locked)
│  └─ Witnesses, contradictions, first hints of abuse
│
├─ Phase 3: THE PAST (app)
│  └─ Historical records, the dead children, the truth
│
├─ Phase 4: FINAL EVIDENCE (locked)
│  └─ Everything connects, solution becomes clear
│
└─ CONCLUSION VIDEO
```

## The Story (No Spoilers)

An isolated Portuguese orphanage with an impeccable reputation. Three devoted nuns found brutally murdered. Impossible evidence. Terrified orphans who won't talk about what happens after 21:00.

And three children who died in "accidents" over the years—children whose belongings keep appearing at the crime scenes.

## Development Approach

This is my second Artefactum game, but the first with:

- **Hybrid format** (previous was pure roleplay)
- **Escape room mechanics** (locks, codes, phases)
- **App integration** (companion digital experience)
- **Darker tone** (horror vs period drama)

### AI Integration

Using AI throughout development for:
- Narrative consistency checking
- Document generation (testimonies, reports)
- Puzzle design validation
- Potentially: in-game AI features (hints, atmosphere)

---

## Current Progress

### Done
- Core concept and narrative
- Character roster (20+ witnesses)
- Game structure (4 phases + intro/conclusion)
- Evidence and impossibilities designed
- GitHub repo: [artefactum_games](https://github.com/marialu1/artefactum_games)

### In Progress
- Game Design Document (defining all mechanics)
- Lock/code puzzle system
- Phase content inventory

### Next
- Write all testimonies and documents
- Design app functionality
- Prototype physical box
- Playtest
