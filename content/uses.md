## üéØ Philosophy

**I'm not a traditional developer.** I use AI heavily to:
- Understand concepts I don't know
- Write code I couldn't write alone
- Debug issues faster
- Learn by doing (with guidance)

**This is possible because:**
- AI tools are REALLY good now
- I'm willing to learn and iterate
- I ask good questions
- I'm not afraid to break things

**See my [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started) guide for how you can do this too.**
