# What I'm Doing Now

*Updated: December 13, 2025*

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by Derek Sivers. It's what I'd tell a friend I haven't seen in a year.

## Current Projects

### **1. AI Business OS** (Artefactum)
Generate complete operational startups from a single business idea. 6-phase DSPy pipeline that creates company structures, AI workers, and strategic variations.

**Status:** Long-term project - huge potential, steep learning curve

**What it does:**
- Input: "I want to create an online marketplace for handmade crafts"
- Output (5 min): Business consultation, 12 specialized AI workers, 3-5 strategic variations, quality-verified outputs

**The reality:** This is ambitious. DSPy, TextGrad, self-improving AI workers - it's cutting-edge stuff that requires deep learning. The core pipeline works, but making it production-ready is a journey, not a sprint.

**Tech:** DSPy, TextGrad, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Groq gpt-oss-120b

**Lines of code:** ~11,600

### **2. Stimulus Collective**
"The Spotify of Experiences" - AI-powered experience curation platform for Basel, Switzerland.

**Status:** MVP running, working with co-founders Alex & Mark

**Key innovation:** Stimulus Scores (5 sensory dimensions) + DSPy Copywriter that learns and improves

**Tech:** FastAPI + DSPy + Astro (scrapbook aesthetic)

---

### **3. AI CV Enhancer**
Transform any CV into a professional document with AI rewriting + template selection.

**Status:** Backend 100% functional, Phase 3.5 (documentation/testing)

**Features working:**

## Tech Stack I'm Comfortable With Now

**Backend:** FastAPI, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Celery
**AI:** DSPy, LiteLLM, Groq, Claude Code
**Frontend:** Next.js, React, Astro, Tailwind
**Database:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis
**DevOps:** Docker, Tailscale, Hetzner, Vercel

## Focus Areas

1. **Shipping products** - Not just experiments, actual working software
2. **AI workers** - Self-aware agents that know what they need
3. **Building in public** - Documenting the messy reality
4. **Revenue** - Making projects sustainable (Stripe, subscriptions)

## What's NOT on My Plate

- Job hunting (building my own thing)
- Freelancing (focused on products)
- Social media (beyond GitHub)
- Tutorials without real projects
