# What I'm Doing Now

*Updated: October 22, 2025*

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by Derek Sivers. It's what I'd tell a friend I haven't seen in a year.

## üöÄ Current Projects

### **1. This Blog** (dominatedbycline.github.io)
Building a platform to document my journey with AI-assisted development.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Live and growing

**Recent additions:**
- Comprehensive beginner guides (Part 1 & 2)
- 12+ site features (RSS, analytics, comments, etc)
- GoatCounter analytics
- Giscus comments

**Next:** More tutorial content, case studies

---

### **2. EventFlow** (Event Planning Platform)
Full-stack event planning app with AI integration. Built in 2 weeks to solve my own chaos.

**Status:** üî® 96% complete (Caroline AI type-safe upgrade done! ‚ú®)

**Recent breakthroughs (Week 2):**
- **Caroline AI type-safe upgrade** - Pydantic schemas, LLM JSON mode enforcement
- **87.5% accuracy** on messy, interrupted, conflicting meeting notes
- **Extraction review workflow** - Planner approves before database commit
- **Traceability system** - Excerpt + justification for every field extracted
- **Auth system** - Added login/register (rookie oversight, caught in time!)
- **9 screenshots** showing real features in action

**Features working:**
- Dashboard with real-time analytics
- Vendor marketplace (mini LinkedIn for event vendors)
- Guest management & RSVP system
- Calendar with full CRUD + modals + toast notifications
- AI Inbox for client conversations ‚Üí structured data
- Caroline (Telegram bot, 47 type-safe tools)
- Task templates (auto-generate 30+ tasks based on event type)
- Project creation wizard with templates
- Authentication & onboarding flow

**Tech stack:** FastAPI, SQLite, Pydantic, LiteLLM, Groq API, Jinja2, Bootstrap 5, Chart.js, python-telegram-bot

**What's left:** Manual testing Caroline in production (tests pass, but real chaos?), deployment to production

### **3. Murder Mystery Game**
A 100+ page interactive murder mystery with automated typesetting.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**What I learned:**
- LaTeX typesetting
- Automated build pipelines
- AI can be surprisingly creative

## üìñ Currently Reading

**Tech:**
- Pydantic documentation (type-safe AI is fascinating!)
- LiteLLM guides (multi-provider LLM magic)
- FastAPI production patterns (Docker, PostgreSQL, deployment)
- AI agent frameworks (smolagents, testing methodologies)

**Non-tech:**

## üéØ Focus Areas

**Right now I'm focused on:**
1. **Creating helpful content** - Guides that actually help beginners
2. **Building in public** - Sharing the messy reality of projects
3. **Learning by doing** - Real projects > tutorials
4. **AI-assisted development** - Pushing what's possible with AI tools

---

## üí≠ Thinking About

- **Making LLMs reliable for production** - Type safety, validation, traceability
- **Testing AI-extracted data** - Automated tests vs real-world chaos (the scary part!)
- **Building trust in AI systems** - Confidence scores, excerpts, justifications
- **AI for chaotic brains** - EventFlow works for me because it solves my own chaos
- **Next project: Interior Design App** - Integrate with EventFlow in the future (event styling + venue design)
- **Nobody's teaching impact** - Architecture wisdom that saved weeks of mistakes
- How to make technical content more accessible
- The intersection of ADHD and coding (ADHD = advantage with AI tools!)
- Building sustainable learning habits with AI

---

## üé® Side Interests

- **Writing** - Making complex things understandable
- **Design** - Learning visual design basics
- **Productivity** - Systems that actually work for ADHD brains
- **Open Source** - Contributing where I can
