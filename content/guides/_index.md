## About These Guides

These were originally one massive post (way too long!).

Now split into 3 digestible parts:
- **Part 1:** Setup and environment (the prerequisites)
- **Part 2:** Workflow and real projects (the reality check)
- **Part 3:** Building websites with Hugo (the practical guide)

Written from the perspective of someone who's **not a developer** but built real projects with AI.

Honest, practical, and covers the "obvious" stuff that nobody explains.
