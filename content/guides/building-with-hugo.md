- Deploying to GitHub Pages
- Common problems and fixes
- How AI helps (and where it doesn't)

**Perfect for:**
- Building a portfolio site
- Creating a blog
- Documenting projects
- Learning web fundamentals
- Getting something online fast

**You'll have by the end:**
- A real website live on the internet
- Understanding of how static sites work
- A deployment workflow that's automated
- Portfolio to show your work

---

## Part 1: Understanding Static Sites

### What's a Static Site Generator?

**Static site generator** (SSG) = a tool that converts simple text files into a complete website

**How it works:**
1. You write content in Markdown (simple text format)
2. SSG converts Markdown ‚Üí HTML
3. You get a folder full of HTML/CSS files
4. Deploy that folder to any web host
5. Website is live

**Examples of SSGs:**
- **Hugo** (what we're using - super fast, Go-based)
- Jekyll (Ruby-based, popular with GitHub Pages)
- 11ty (JavaScript-based)
- Gatsby (React-based, complex)

### Why Use a Static Site Instead of WordPress/Squarespace?

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Free hosting** (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages)
- ‚úÖ **Fast** (just HTML files, no database queries)
- ‚úÖ **Secure** (nothing to hack, no backend)
- ‚úÖ **Version controlled** (all in Git)
- ‚úÖ **Full control** (customize everything)
- ‚úÖ **Write in Markdown** (clean, portable, AI-friendly)
- ‚úÖ **No vendor lock-in** (move anytime)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå No visual editor (you edit text files)
- ‚ùå Steeper learning curve initially
- ‚ùå No dynamic features without JavaScript/APIs
- ‚ùå Have to rebuild when you change content

**Best for:**
- Blogs, portfolios, documentation, project showcases, personal sites

**Not great for:**
- E-commerce, user authentication, real-time content, collaborative editing (unless you add services)

### Why Hugo Specifically?

**Hugo advantages:**
- ‚ö° **Blazing fast** (builds 1000s of pages in seconds)
- üì¶ **Single binary** (one file, no dependencies)
- üé® **Great themes** (free, customizable)
- üìñ **Good docs** (once you understand basics)
- üîÑ **Live reload** (see changes instantly)
- üÜì **Free and open source**

**The catch:** Hugo has a learning curve. This guide makes it manageable.

## Part 2: Hugo Basics (From Scratch)

### Installation

**Linux/WSL:**
```bash
sudo apt install hugo
hugo version  # Check it worked
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install hugo
hugo version
```

**Windows:**
Download from https://gohugo.io/installation/

**Check it worked:**
```bash
hugo version
# Should show: hugo v0.XX.X ...
```

### Creating Your First Site

**1. Create a new site:**
```bash
hugo new site my-website
cd my-website
```

**2. See what Hugo created:**
```bash
ls
```

**You'll see:**
```
archetypes/   # Content templates
content/      # Your posts and pages go here
data/         # Data files
layouts/      # Custom HTML templates
static/       # Images, CSS, files
themes/       # Themes folder
hugo.toml     # Configuration file
```

**What each folder does:**
- `content/` - Write your blog posts, pages here (Markdown)
- `static/` - Images, PDFs, any files you want accessible
- `themes/` - Downloaded themes
- `layouts/` - Custom templates (override themes)
- `hugo.toml` - Site settings, menu, parameters

### Adding a Theme

**Hugo needs a theme to know how to style your site.**

**Option 1: Download a theme (Archie example)**
```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/athul/archie themes/archie
```

**Edit `hugo.toml` to use it:**
```toml
baseURL = 'http://localhost:1313/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'My Awesome Site'
theme = 'archie'
```

**Popular beginner themes:**
- **Archie** - Minimal, clean (what I use)
- **PaperMod** - Modern blog theme
- **Terminal** - Retro hacker aesthetic
- **Anatole** - Portfolio-focused

**Find themes:** https://themes.gohugo.io/

### Creating Content

**Create your first post:**
```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

**Hugo creates:** `content/posts/my-first-post.md`

**Open it and edit:**
```markdown
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2024-10-22
draft: false
tags: ["hello", "first-post"]
---

# Hello World!

This is my first Hugo post. It's written in **Markdown**.

## I can add:
- Lists
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks
- Images

Pretty cool!
```

**Important:** Change `draft: false` or it won't show up!

### Running the Local Server

**Start Hugo's development server:**
```bash
hugo server
```

**Output:**
```
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

**Open your browser:** http://localhost:1313/

**You should see your site!**

**Live reload:** Edit your post, save. The browser updates automatically. Magic.

## Part 3: Building Your Portfolio Site

### Site Structure for a Portfolio

**Typical structure:**
```
content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md          # Homepage content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.md           # About page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ posts/             # Blog posts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ post-1.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ post-2.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/          # Project showcases
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-1.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-2.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ now.md             # What you're doing now
```

### Creating Pages

**Homepage content** (`content/_index.md`):
```markdown
---
title: "Home"
---

# Hi, I'm [Your Name]

I build things and document the process.

Check out my [projects](/projects) or read my [blog](/posts).
```

**About page** (`content/about.md`):
```markdown
---
title: "About"
---

# About Me

I'm learning web development with AI assistance.

This site showcases my projects and documents the learning process.
```

**Project page** (`content/projects/eventflow/index.md`):
```markdown
---
title: "EventFlow"
date: 2024-10-15
tags: ["project", "fastapi", "ai"]
---

# EventFlow: AI-Powered Event Planning

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## What It Does
EventFlow helps chaotic planners organize events without losing their minds.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI backend
- SQLite database
- AI extraction with Pydantic

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/...)
```

### Adding Navigation

**Edit `hugo.toml` to add menu:**
```toml
[[menu.main]]
  name = "Home"
  url = "/"
  weight = 1

[[menu.main]]
  name = "About"
  url = "/about"
  weight = 2

[[menu.main]]
  name = "Projects"
  url = "/projects"
  weight = 3

[[menu.main]]
  name = "Blog"
  url = "/posts"
  weight = 4
```

**Weight controls order** (lower = appears first)

### Adding Images

**1. Put images in `static/images/`:**
```
static/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ avatar.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-screenshot.png
```

**2. Reference in Markdown:**
```markdown
![My Avatar](/images/avatar.png)
```

**Hugo serves files from `static/` at the root URL**

---

## Part 4: Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account (free)
- Git installed ([Part 1](/guides/getting-started/))
- Your Hugo site ready

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

**1. Go to GitHub.com**

**2. Click "New Repository"**

**3. Name it:** `your-username.github.io`
   - Example: `marialuisa.github.io`
   - This special name gives you `https://your-username.github.io`

**4. Make it public**

**5. Don't initialize with README** (we'll push existing code)

**6. Click "Create Repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Site to GitHub

**In your Hugo project folder:**

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Your code is now on GitHub!**

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions for Deployment

**Create the workflow file:**

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

**Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:**

```yaml
name: Deploy Hugo site to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'
          extended: true

      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: ./public

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

**Commit and push this:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
git push
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

**1. Go to your repo on GitHub**

**2. Settings ‚Üí Pages (left sidebar)**

**3. Source:** GitHub Actions

**4. Save**

**Done!** Your site will build and deploy automatically.

### Step 5: Fix the Base URL

**Edit `hugo.toml`:**

**Before:**
```toml
baseURL = 'http://localhost:1313/'
```

**After:**
```toml
baseURL = 'https://your-username.github.io/'
```

**Commit and push:**
```bash
git add hugo.toml
git commit -m "Fix base URL for GitHub Pages"
git push
```

**Wait 2-3 minutes** ‚Üí Visit `https://your-username.github.io`

**Your site is LIVE! üéâ**

---

## Part 5: Common Problems & Solutions

### "My site is blank!"

**Possible causes:**

**1. Base URL is wrong**
```toml
# In hugo.toml, make sure this matches your GitHub Pages URL
baseURL = 'https://your-username.github.io/'
```

**2. Draft posts aren't showing**
```markdown
# In your post front matter:
draft: false  # Make sure this is false!
```

**3. Theme not loaded**
```bash
# Make sure theme is added as submodule:
git submodule add https://github.com/theme/repo themes/theme-name

# In hugo.toml:
theme = 'theme-name'  # Exact folder name in themes/
```

**4. Deployment still running**
- Go to Actions tab on GitHub
- Wait for green checkmark
- Can take 2-5 minutes

### "CSS/Images aren't loading!"

**Problem:** Absolute vs relative paths

**Solution:** Use paths starting with `/`
```markdown
# Good:
![Image](/images/photo.png)

# Bad:
![Image](images/photo.png)
```

**Or check baseURL in `hugo.toml`**

### "Changes aren't showing up!"

**Possible causes:**

**1. Browser cache**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

**2. Deployment hasn't finished**
- Check GitHub Actions tab
- Wait for build to complete

**3. Changes not pushed**
```bash
git status  # Check what's uncommitted
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push
```

### "Git submodule issues"

**If theme isn't loading after clone:**
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**If you see "not a git repository":**
```bash
cd themes/your-theme
git status  # Should show it's a repo
```

### "Build failed in GitHub Actions"

**1. Check the error logs:**
- Go to Actions tab
- Click the failed workflow
- Read the error message

**2. Common errors:**
- Theme not found ‚Üí submodule not loaded
- Invalid YAML syntax in front matter
- Missing `baseURL` in config
- Hugo version too old

**Ask AI:** Copy error message to Claude/Cline, ask "What does this mean?"

---

## Part 6: Workflow & Tips

### Daily Workflow

**1. Create content:**
```bash
hugo new posts/new-post.md
# Edit the file
```

**2. Preview locally:**
```bash
hugo server
# Visit http://localhost:1313
```

**3. When happy, deploy:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add post about X"
git push
```

**4. Wait 2-3 minutes, site updates automatically**

**Total time:** 30 seconds of commands

### How AI Helps

**Claude/Cline is great for:**
- Explaining Hugo concepts
- Debugging build errors
- Writing front matter templates
- Creating shortcodes
- Custom CSS tweaks
- Git issues

**Example conversation:**

**Me:** "How do I add a custom section to my homepage?"

**AI:** "Create `layouts/index.html` to override the theme's homepage. Here's a template:
```html
{{ define "main" }}
  <h1>Custom Homepage</h1>
  <!-- Your content here -->
{{ end }}
```
Hugo uses this instead of the theme's version."

**Me:** "Can you explain how layouts work?"

**AI:** *explains template hierarchy in plain language*

### Customization Tips

**Don't edit themes directly!**

**Instead, override in your `layouts/` folder:**

**Example:** Custom homepage
- Theme has: `themes/archie/layouts/index.html`
- Create: `layouts/index.html`
- Yours takes precedence

**Example:** Custom CSS
- Create: `static/css/custom.css`
- Add to `hugo.toml`:
```toml
[params]
  customCSS = ["css/custom.css"]
```

### Content Organization

**Good structure:**
```
content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ posts/           # Blog posts (chronological)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/        # Portfolio pieces (featured)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ guides/          # Evergreen tutorials
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.md         # About page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ now.md           # Current status
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uses.md          # Tools you use
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear separation of content types
- Easy to find things
- Scales well
- Hugo auto-generates list pages

---

## Part 7: Next Steps & Advanced Features

### Features to Add

**Once basics are working:**

**1. RSS Feed** (usually built-in)
```
https://your-site.com/index.xml
```

**2. Comments** - Add Giscus (GitHub Discussions-based)
- Free, privacy-friendly
- No ads, no tracking

**3. Analytics** - Add GoatCounter
- Privacy-friendly
- Free
- No cookies needed

**4. Search** - Add client-side search
- No backend needed
- Fast, works offline

**5. Tags & Categories**
```markdown
---
tags: ["hugo", "web-dev"]
categories: ["tutorials"]
---
```

**6. Reading time, word count** (built into Hugo)

**7. Social sharing buttons**

**8. Custom domain** (optional, costs $12/year)

### Learning Resources

**Official Hugo Docs:** https://gohugo.io/documentation/
- Comprehensive but assumes knowledge
- Use AI to translate to plain language

**Hugo Themes:** https://themes.gohugo.io/
- Explore for inspiration
- Read theme docs carefully

**Hugo Discourse:** https://discourse.gohugo.io/
- Community forum
- Search before asking

**This site's source code:** https://github.com/dominatedbycline/dominatedbycline.github.io
- See how I built this
- Copy what works

### When to Ask AI vs Search Yourself

**Ask AI when:**
- Concept is confusing (explain like I'm 5)
- Error message is cryptic
- Docs assume too much knowledge
- You need a custom solution

**Search/Read docs when:**
- Looking for specific features
- Browsing theme options
- Learning new Hugo functions
- Exploring what's possible

**Best approach:** Combine both. Search to find the feature, ask AI to explain it.

## The Reality Check

**What I wish someone had told me:**

**1. The first deployment will fail**
- It's normal
- Check the logs
- Fix one error at a time
- Eventually it works

**2. Themes are opinionated**
- Some are well-documented, some aren't
- Customizing requires understanding Hugo
- Start simple, customize later

**3. Hugo's learning curve is real**
- But it flattens quickly
- After 2 weeks, it clicks
- After 1 month, you're comfortable

**4. AI makes it WAY easier**
- Explanations in plain language
- Instant debugging help
- Custom solutions without deep Hugo knowledge

**5. Your first site will be messy**
- That's ok!
- You can refactor later
- Shipping > perfection

---

## Success Criteria

**You've succeeded when:**
- ‚úÖ Site is live on the internet
- ‚úÖ You can create and publish posts
- ‚úÖ Changes deploy automatically
- ‚úÖ You understand how it works (at least basically)
- ‚úÖ You can debug common issues

**You don't need to:**
- ‚ùå Understand every Hugo feature
- ‚ùå Write custom themes
- ‚ùå Master Go templating
- ‚ùå Know all the configuration options

**Progress > perfection**

Start messy. Ship it. Improve iteratively.
